            <p>
            I'm a 4th Year Combined Mathematics & Computer Science Student at UBC, with an interest in full-stack engineering, iOS app development and all things music production.

When I'm not building apps and/or studying, you can find me playing the piano, playing Nintendo Switch, or tinkering with Logic Pro X.
